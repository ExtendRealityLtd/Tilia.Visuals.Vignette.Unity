### [1.0.1](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.Visuals.Vignette.Unity/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1) (2023-06-29)

#### Bug Fixes

* **Prefabs:** update origin position of prefab ([bd28a4d](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.Visuals.Vignette.Unity/commit/bd28a4d7d1106822328f40cfa76f76aa489f5ce9))
  > The origin position of the prefab has been reduced to 0.2f along the z axis so it is closer to the camera view and reduces the likelihood of showing the external world around the edge of the vignette object.

## 1.0.0 (2023-06-14)

#### Features

* **structure:** create initial prefab and guides ([42c1af7](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.Visuals.Vignette.Unity/commit/42c1af770777b066a9b6101739dd8f58a7c93eff))
